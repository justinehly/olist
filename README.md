#### Project Overview
We chose the Olist dataset(s) available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) for Machine Learning 1 in the Southern Methodist Master of Data Science program.

#### About the Dataset
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on our website: www.olist.com

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

###### Attention
1. An order might have multiple items.
2. Each item might be fulfilled by a distinct seller.
3. All text identifying stores and partners where replaced by the names of Game of Thrones great houses.
